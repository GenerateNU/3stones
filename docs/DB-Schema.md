Notes I took while working on database schema
# General notes
- Everything should have created_at and/or updated_at
    - updated_at seems like a PITA so hold on one sec
- TODO: Lots of 'description' fields on these tables - do we want this to be plaintext or markdown/more fancy format? Mostly a design thing.
- All locations are addresses
- TODO: Constraint checking on shares: the shares that users have bought of a project should never exceed its total_shares (obv), consequently theres also some stuff we could maybe do to calculate remaining shares, idk.
- TODO: fuck we need to keep purchase history
    - I think if we just change user_shares to user_shares_purchases (table stores # of shares user has in a project -> table stores purchases of shares of project over time that a user made) this fixes it well, though this could result in some complex queries for getting total shares user has in a project, shares remaining, etc.
# Models and their table details
- Users
    - Supabase ID as primary key
        - Auth middleware will handle syncing (if the given token is valid but is for a user with no entry, create that entry)
    - First and last name
    - TODO: what other fields would we want here?
- Project
    - Developer id (associates the project w/ the developer)
    - Title & description
    - Location
    - Total shares, price/share
    - TODO: what other financial info (or any info) do we want here?
- Developer
    - Company name
    - Location
    - Description
    - TODO: What other descriptive information do we want?
- User projects
    - Effectively a M2M association - Keep a User id and Project id on this one
    - Quantity of shares in the given property
- Project posts
    - Updates/events on the property
    - Since there's only one developer per project we just need an project ID here
    - Title, Text (TODO: anything else we'd like?)
- Project progress updates
    - Think % progress bar - the reason this would be its own table and not just a field upon a given project entry is so users can see progress over time
    - Needs project ID (obviously)
    - Current progress (ensure this is always between 0 and 100)
- Images on projects
    - Project ID and link to image URL
    - TODO: since we aren't doing developer URL, do we want to set up S3 infra or have image links be to like cats or random stock photos rn.
        - I vote for S3 infra as reach feature (if we have time), this is something I fear we'd get bogged down on.
- Images on project posts
    - Post ID and link to image URL
