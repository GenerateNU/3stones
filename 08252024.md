- Supabase client
    - https://github.com/nedpals/supabase-go
        - supa.CreateClient()
        - this can be added to serviceparams, no biggie
            - supabase client shouldn't be added but some sort of Auth object (that wraps it)
                - opens up future to ditching this for other auth solutions
        - how can middleware access this?
            - middleware works by having functions that return a fiber.Handler
            - we can create a function on our central Auth service that returns a fiber.Handler
- Auth object
    - login
    - register
    - refresh
    - logout
    - get user?
        - these all have respective handlers in nedpals/supabase-go

- Login/register endpoints
    - auth routes/controllers/transactions that use the auth object, im not stressing about this.

- Middleware
    - How do we want to handle this?
    - For now, just have protected endpoint: needs to be a valid access token or just wont let you hit the endpoint.
        - Rough idea for this:
            - User sends access token in header
            - Looks like supabase just has a user function which takes that access token?
                - ok thats easy
            - Pass this user into the context
