# 3 Stones

3 Stones is a mobile app where developers crowdfund real estate projects by posting them for investors. These developers raise the necessary capital to develop properties, while investors can explore the listings, contribute small amounts, and build a real estate portfolio to earn profits when the properties are sold.
